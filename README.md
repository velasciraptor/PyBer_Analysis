# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview:
Pyber is a ride-sharing app that hired me to examine the difference between urban, suburban, and rural cities. This data was analyzed by investigating the amount of drivers, riders, and the cost of fares for each of the city types mentioned. The initial analysis was in-depth with detail. In this project, a summary was created with the focus being the cost of fares over time for each city type.

## Results:
Below is a dataframe that summarizes the the differences between city types. We can see that the greatest differences are between rural and urban cities. They hold either the minimum or maximum value in each category with suburban cities always in the middle. This is to be expected as urban populations are much larger than rural populations. Ergo, urban cities have the most rides, drivers, and the largest total fares. In rural cities, we find the most expensive fares per ride, and we see that because the driver "supply" is so low, the average fare per driver is very high.

Below is a multiple-line chart that shows how fares changed over time. More specifically, I calculated the total amount for fares every week from Jan. 1, 2019 - April 29, 2019. Here, we see the same results as we did with the dataframe. Because urban cities received the most rides, and although their fares were the cheapest, the sum of the total fares was far higher than the amount for rural cities with suburban cities happily sitting in the center.

## Summary:
There is a statement summarizing three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.

Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
