# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview:
PyBer is a ride-sharing app that hired me to examine the difference between urban, suburban, and rural cities. This data was analyzed by investigating the amount of drivers, riders, and the cost of fares for each of the city types mentioned. The initial analysis was in-depth with detail. In this project, a summary was created with the focus being the cost of fares over time for each city type.

## Results:
### PyBer Summary DataFrame
Below is a dataframe that summarizes the the differences between city types. We can see that the greatest differences are between rural and urban cities. They hold either the minimum or maximum value in each category with suburban cities always in the middle. This is to be expected as urban populations are much larger than rural populations. Ergo, urban cities have the most rides, the most drivers, and the largest total fares. In rural cities, we find the most expensive fares per ride, and we see that because the driver "supply" is so low, the average fare per driver is very high.

### PyBer Summary Multiple-Line Chart
Below is a multiple-line chart that shows how fares changed over time. More specifically, I calculated the total amount for fares every week from Jan. 1, 2019 - April 29, 2019. Here, we see the same results as we did with the dataframe. Because urban cities received the most rides, and although their fares were the cheapest, the sum of the total fares every week was far higher than the amount for rural cities with suburban cities happily sitting in the center.

## Summary:
### 3 recommendations for addressing disparities among the city types.

- Increase the amount of drivers in rural cities. Rural cities have the smallest amount of rides and therefore the smallest amount of total fares. Increasing the amount of drivers will allow demand to grow.
- Reduce prices in rural cities. There are 2 possibilities why rural cities have the smallest amount of rides and revenue, because they either cannot find a driver or the fare is too expensive. All other possibilities at outside the control of the company. Recommendation 1 allowed for more drivers, and this recommendation fixes the remaining issue.
- In urban cities, increase advertising to bring in more riders. Drivers outnumber rides by 148%. The law of supply and demand dictates that supply should equal demand so that the prices do not drop too low for producers (PyBer) to continue or grow their business.
